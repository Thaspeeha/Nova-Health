## 🏥 NovaHealth - Preventive Health Intelligence System

The **Preventive Health Intelligence System** transforms **raw, fragmented health data** into **actionable insights** to support **proactive public health decision-making**.  

It integrates **multiple data sources**:  
- 🧾 Medical records  
- 💊 Pharmaceutical usage  
- 📊 Health surveys  
- 🌍 Environmental indicators  


## ❗ Problem Statement

How can medical and public health organizations efficiently process **messy, multi-format data** from documents, spreadsheets, and JSON files while:

- Avoiding operational bottlenecks  
- Detecting early risk signals  
- Escalating high-impact cases in time  
- Ensuring transparency, compliance, and auditability  


## 💡 Solution Overview

Opus automates the full workflow by:

- Ingesting **multi-format health data**
- Structuring and validating key fields
- Detecting emerging risks using AI
- Applying **rule-based, explainable decisions**
- Routing sensitive or high-risk cases to **automated or human review**

The platform ensures **reliable outcomes** while preserving **human oversight where required**.


## 🧠 Methodology
