## 🏥 NovaHealth - Preventive Health Intelligence System

The **Preventive Health Intelligence System** transforms **raw, fragmented health data** into **actionable insights** to support **proactive public health decision-making**.  

It integrates **multiple data sources**:  
- 🧾 Medical records  
- 💊 Pharmaceutical usage  
- 📊 Health surveys  
- 🌍 Environmental indicators  

All data is **standardized** into a unified structure, with **personally identifiable information removed**.  

The system then:  
- 📍 Categorizes data by **region**  
- 📈 Performs **regional risk matrix analysis** to detect emerging **health threats** and priority areas  
- 📝 Generates **regional forecasts**, **targeted intervention plans**, and **public health alerts**  

All reports are **reviewed by experts** before dissemination to ensure accuracy.  

By combining **automation 🤖, data intelligence 📊, and human judgment 🧠**, the system empowers organizations to:  
- Monitor health risks continuously  
- Enable early response to emerging threats  
- Strengthen preventive healthcare strategies across regions
