# 🖥️ AI Genesis Hackathon 2025 🛠️


## ✨ The Challenge

Design a reusable “Intake → Understand → Decide → Review → Deliver” automation that tackles the messy reality of multi‑format intake, mixed rule‑based + judgment decisions, and exception handling—while keeping every step traceable. Public/demo data and free external APIs are fine; enterprise integrations are not expected.

## 🛠️ What You’ll Build

Create one end‑to‑end Opus workflow that tackles a real use case in an industry of your choice. Demonstrate it with realistic sample inputs.

Required building blocks:

- Data import & processing: Import from an external source (file, sheet, or public API) and make processed records available downstream.
- Decisioning & routing: Combine deterministic rules (thresholds, required fields, format checks) with AI reasoning (categorization, summarization). Support multi‑condition logic, parallelize independent steps, and handle errors/timeouts sensibly.
- Review for quality & safety: Include at least two checkpoints—Agentic Review (policy/guidance checks) and Human Review for low‑confidence or high‑impact cases.
- Provenance & audit: Generate a compact audit artifact (JSON or PDF) capturing inputs, extracted fields + confidence, rules fired, scores/rationales, review actions, timestamps, IDs, and any external source URLs.
- Delivery: Export outcomes (e.g., via email or Google Sheets).


### 🧰 Technology You Can Use:

- No‑code: prompt‑to‑workflow generation and the visual canvas builder.
- Developers: Opus Code node (custom Python), External Service node (public APIs), and Data Import/Export for supported platforms; jobs can be triggered via API.


## 🏥 NovaHealth - Preventive Health Intelligence System

The **Preventive Health Intelligence System** transforms **raw, fragmented health data** into **actionable insights** to support **proactive public health decision-making**.  

It integrates **multiple data sources**:  
- 🧾 Medical records  
- 💊 Pharmaceutical usage  
- 📊 Health surveys  
- 🌍 Environmental indicators  


## ❗ Problem Statement

How can medical and public health organizations efficiently process **messy, multi-format data** from documents, spreadsheets, and JSON files while:

- Avoiding operational bottlenecks  
- Detecting early risk signals  
- Escalating high-impact cases in time  
- Ensuring transparency, compliance, and auditability  


## 💡 Solution Overview

Opus automates the full workflow by:

- Ingesting **multi-format health data**
- Structuring and validating key fields
- Detecting emerging risks using AI
- Applying **rule-based, explainable decisions**
- Routing sensitive or high-risk cases to **automated or human review**

The platform ensures **reliable outcomes** while preserving **human oversight where required**.


## 🧠 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Standardization
- Collect medical, pharmaceutical, survey, and environmental data  
- Normalize formats for consistency and downstream analysis  

### 2️⃣ Cleansing & Privacy
- Remove or mask sensitive personal data  
- Ensure compliance with privacy and regulatory requirements  

### 3️⃣ Risk Analysis & Insights
- Regional classification of health data  
- AI-driven risk scoring and trend forecasting  
- Identification of emerging threats and anomalies  
- Suggested interventions based on risk levels  

### 4️⃣ Reporting & Delivery
- Generate validated reports and alerts  
- Deliver dashboards for health authorities and stakeholders  
- Support traceable decision records for audit and review
